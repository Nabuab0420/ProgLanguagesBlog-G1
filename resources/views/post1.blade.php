                        <p class="text-justify" style="font-family:Aclonica, sans-serif;">Once, only a few people were considered computer programmers with cutting-edge coding skills. Now, many IT jobs require a solid grasp of the top programming languages — yes, more than one.&nbsp;If you’re trying to advance in your
                            career or change careers completely and need to master a programming language, you might wonder which one to learn. After all, it will take time and money to learn the language, so you want to make the right choice.Several
                            considerations come into play when making your decision, like the difficulty level you’re willing to learn, the knowledge you already possess that align with your existing coding skills, or your reasons for learning a top programming
                            language.&nbsp;Whether you want to develop a mobile application, get certification for programming knowledge, or learn new skills, you need to learn the right programming language. Below you’ll learn about 10 popular programming
                            languages that will be in demand among employers in 2021. You’ll find about each language, its complexity, and how it is used.<br><br></p>
