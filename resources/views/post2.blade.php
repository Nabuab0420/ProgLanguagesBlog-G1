                        <p class="text-justify" style="font-family:Aclonica, sans-serif;">Coding can be challenging. Whether you’re learning to code through self-study, a coding bootcamp, or college courses, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. For this reason, many beginning programmers benefit from starting out with one
                            of the easier&nbsp;<a href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/how-many-coding-languages-are-there/">programming languages</a>.<br><br></p>

                        <h4 style="font-family:Aclonica, sans-serif;"><strong>1. HTML</strong><br></h4>
                        <p class="text-justify" style="font-family:Aclonica, sans-serif;">Although HTML isn’t technically a programming language,&nbsp;<a href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/learn-html/">learning how to create an HTML</a>&nbsp;page is often the first step in learning how to program. &nbsp;You might recognize
                            “HTML” as part of a link to a website or in your browser’s address bar. It stands for Hypertext Markup Language.&nbsp;<a href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/what-is-html-used-for/">HTML was originally designed</a>&nbsp;to help
                            people format their text documents, so they can be presented to readers in a cleaner way.<br></p>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-md-6">
                                <figure class="figure"><img class="rounded img-fluid figure-img" src="assets/img/170427-637363828865101045-16x9.jpg" alt="A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure."></figure>
                            </div>
                            <div class="col">
                                <p class="text-justify" style="font-family:Aclonica, sans-serif;">With HTML, you build documents with building blocks named elements. For example, the element that contains the main content of an HTML page is named the “body” element. Inside the body element, you will often see multiple
                                    “paragraph” elements represented by a “&lt;p&gt;” that indicate to the browser where each paragraph resides.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <h4 style="font-family:Aclonica, sans-serif;"><strong>2. CSS</strong><br></h4>
                        <p class="text-justify" style="font-family:Aclonica, sans-serif;"><a href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/what-is-css/">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a>&nbsp;are most commonly used to define how a webpage should look when viewed by a browser. For example, you can set the text color or background
                            color of certain elements with CSS.<br><br></p>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col">
                                <p class="text-justify" style="font-family:Aclonica, sans-serif;">However, you can also define animations and when they should be shown to the user, decide when to hide or show certain content, and control the positioning of the page’s elements. Used properly, CSS can improve the look,
                                    readability, and functionality of a website.&nbsp;In fact, the article you’re reading right now is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br><br></p>

                        <h4 style="font-family:Aclonica, sans-serif;"><strong>3. JavaScript</strong><br></h4>
                        <p class="text-justify" style="font-family:Aclonica, sans-serif;"><a href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/what-is-javascript/">JavaScript (JS)</a>&nbsp;is commonly used in combination with HTML and CSS to implement client-side functionality through small “scripts.” This is why it’s often referred
                            to as a “scripting language.”This functionality includes actions like showing more details when a user clicks on a button or enhancing a text field to show the user if their password satisfies security requirements.But it also
                            includes more complex behavior, like securely sending and retrieving information to another server. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together in this way is often referred to as front end development.However, just because JavaScript
                            is usually used to manipulate HTML elements or provide UI functionality doesn’t mean that those are its only functions. JavaScript is still powerful enough to accomplish tasks like implementing a search algorithm, analyzing
                            data provided by a user, or solving mathematical equations. There are even&nbsp;<a href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/best-free-game-engines/">game engines</a>&nbsp;built with JavaScript that can have impressive results!&nbsp;<br><br></p>
                        <div
                            class="row">
                            <div class="col-md-6">
                                <figure class="figure"><img class="rounded img-fluid figure-img" src="assets/img/java-script.jpg" alt="A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure."></figure>
                            </div>
                            <div class="col">
                                <p class="text-justify" style="font-family:Aclonica, sans-serif;">Furthermore, JavaScript isn’t limited to implementing client-side functionality. Projects like Node.js allow developers to create standard&nbsp;<a href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/client-vs-server-side-development/">server-side</a>&nbsp;functionality
                                    with JavaScript. With Javascript, you can be an effective developer on the&nbsp;<a href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/javascript-front-end-or-back-end/">front end&nbsp;and&nbsp;the back end.</a>JavaScript demonstrates
                                    that just because a programming language is typically used in a certain way, this may not be its only use. While many people think of JavaScript as a simple scripting language, there are no limits to what you can do
                                    with it (or any programming language, for that matter).<br><br><br></p>
